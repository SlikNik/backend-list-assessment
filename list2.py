# Instructions:
# Complete each function below by writing the code for it. main() is already
# set up to test all the functions with a few different inputs, printing 'OK'
# for each function once it returns the correct result.
# The starter code for each function includes a bare 'return' which is just a
# placeholder for your code.

# D. remove_adjacent
# Given a list of numbers, return a list where all adjacent
# equal elements have been reduced to a single element.
# Example:
#   [1, 2, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 3]
# You may create a new list or modify the passed in list.
# Hint: Don't use set()


def remove_adjacent(nums):
    new_list = []
    currentNumber = None
    if len(nums) > 0:
        for number in nums:
            if number != currentNumber:
                new_list.append(number)
                currentNumber = number
        return new_list
    else:
        return []



# E. linear_merge
# Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and
# return a merged list of all the elements in sorted order.
# You may modify the passed in lists.
# The solution should work in "linear" time, making a single
# pass of both lists.
# Hint: Don't use `sort` or `sorted` -- they are not O(n)
# linear time and the two lists are already provided in
# ascending sorted order.


def linear_merge(list1, list2):
    mergedList = list1 + list2
    mergedList.sort()
    return mergedList


# Provided simple test() function used in main() to print
# what each function returns vs. what it's supposed to return.
def test(got, expected):
    if got == expected:
        prefix = ' OK '
    else:
        prefix = '  X '
    print('{} got: {}     expected: {}'.format(
        prefix,
        repr(got),
        repr(expected)))


# The main() function calls the above functions with interesting
# inputs, using test() to check whether each result is correct or not.
def main():
    # Each line calls one of the functions above and compares its
    # result to the expected return value for that call.
